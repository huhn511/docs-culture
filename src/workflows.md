# Workflows

- Before merging a Pull Request - check if documentaiton is up to date.


Ideas:
- Docs Page automatically update if related project pushes to `main`branch.
- Project GitHub pages can be used for "development-stage" of docs (Gitub Action Deploys `dev` branch on update).
- Each project lead invites for contribution with an "how to" video.
